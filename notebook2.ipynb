        "This coursework aims to give you experience working on a real-world project. You are provided with a recent dataset and guiding questions. Informed by your analysis, you will make decisions and ultimately answer the business questions and present your recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "This coursework is **not** just about filling out the missing code snippets and providing broad answers. It is intentionally designed to lead you through the often-unclear stages of data analysis: starting with broad questions, formulating your own deeper lines of inquiry, and then seeking patterns and insights to make evidence-based decisions and conclusions. **This spirit of independent inquiry is central to the coursework and will be rewarded**.\n",
        "\n",
        "As part of this coursework, you will discuss your implementation details, insights, and the justification for your decisions in your report. It is therefore advisable to look beyond the guide questions and explore the dataset so you can provide well-supported decisions and recommendations.\n",

        "\n",
        "You have been hired as a Data Scientist by a UK university that plans to launch a new degree programme OR revamp an existing degree programme. The university seeks evidence on commercial feasibility, student demand, and the competitive landscape. As part of this project, you will analyse the [National Student Survey (NSS)](https://www.thestudentsurvey.com/) 2025 dataset (survey conducted in April 2025). Working from broad questions set by the Executive Board, your task is to explore the dataset, generate insights, and write an executive summary (your report) that contains your reflections and recommendation for the new OR existing degree programme based on evidence.\n",

        "3. **Execution order**: Run from top to bottom. Tasks are numbered and output of some tasks can be utilised in other tasks.\n",
        "4. **Reproducibility**: Avoid editing data in place without keeping a copy; prefer creating tidy tables.\n",
        "5. **Your answers**: Your answers are saved at the end of each task in a specified format in a dictionary named (`all_answers`). At the end of each task, there's code that appends your result to `all_answers`. For each task, you must save your answer at the required location (the line after the comment *\"STORE YOUR RESULTS HERE\"*) in the specified data structure. There is a method (`add_to_answer())` to help you append your answer for each task to your overall answers in (`all_answers`).

For example, if you select `cah1_subject = \"social sciences\"` then `cah2_subject` subcategories are ['sociology, social policy and anthropology', 'health and social care',\n",

For example, for a given `cah1_subject` if you calculate the sum for populations of its subcategories (i.e., the sums of `cah2_subject` or `cah3_subject` populations), it will not necessarily match the sum of `cah1_subject`population. For this coursework, whereever you are required to sum a population, you will take the **sum the unique population values**. This provides an in-direct measure of the sum of populations that is sufficient for the tasks in this coursework. Please see **Example 1** that shows the correct way of calculating the unique sum of populations.\n",
